          <h2>What is <span class="highlight">BS in Marine Biology?</span></h2>
          <p class="intro p-left">A Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology is an undergraduate degree focused on the study of marine life and ocean ecosystems. It combines biology, oceanography, ecology, chemistry, and environmental science to explore the rich diversity of organisms that inhabit our seas — from microscopic plankton to massive whales, and everything in between. Students in this program gain hands-on experience through lab work, field research, and even dives into coastal or deep-sea environments.</p>
          
          <h2>Why is Marine Biology <span class="highlight">Important?</span></h2>
          <p class="intro p-left">The ocean covers over 70% of our planet, supports nearly all life on Earth, and plays a crucial role in regulating climate, producing oxygen, and feeding billions of people. Studying marine biology is essential because:</p>

              <p class="intro">It helps us understand and protect marine ecosystems threatened by pollution, climate change, and overfishing.</p>

              <p class="intro">It contributes to medical and scientific discoveries, such as new antibiotics or sustainable food sources.</p>
              <p class="intro">It deepens our understanding of Earth’s climate systems and how human activity affects them. In short: Marine biology is at the heart of ocean conservation and the health of our planet.</p>
