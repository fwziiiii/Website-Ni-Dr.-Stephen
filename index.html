            <h2>What You Need to Know About <span class="highlight">BS in Marine Biology?</span></h2>
            <p class="intro p-left">Bachelor of Science in Marine Biology (BS Marine Biology) is an undergraduate degree program that provides comprehensive study and understanding of marine life and ocean ecosystems. This program combines various scientific disciplines such as biology, ecology, oceanography, chemistry, and environmental science to explore the diverse organisms that inhabit marine environments — from microscopic plankton and coral reefs to large marine mammals like whales and dolphins.</p>
            <p class="intro p-left">Students in this program learn about the structure, function, behavior, and interactions of marine species, as well as the physical and chemical properties of the ocean. The curriculum emphasizes both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, including laboratory techniques, field research, data analysis, and sometimes scuba diving for underwater studies.</p>
            <p class="intro p-left">The program also addresses important issues such as marine conservation, the impact of climate change and pollution on oceans, sustainable fisheries management, and the protection of endangered species. Graduates are equipped to pursue careers in marine research, environmental consulting, conservation organizations, aquaculture, education, and government agencies focused on marine and coastal resource management.</p>

            <h2 style="padding-top: 30px;">Why the Ocean Matters: <span class="highlight">The Role of Marine Biology</span></h2>
            <p class="intro p-left">Marine biology is critically important because it helps us understand and protect one of the largest and most vital ecosystems on Earth — the oceans. Covering more than 70% of the planet’s surface, oceans regulate climate, produce oxygen, and support a vast diversity of life forms, many of which are essential for ecological balance and human survival.</p>

              <p class="intro">First and foremost, we've always been interested in animals—whether they live on land, in water, or in the sky. I’ve been eager to understand the environments they inhabit. When it came time to choose a program, I was initially more familiar with BS biology than with marine biology specifically. But as I explored further, I discovered that marine biology goes beyond just studying marine animals—it also covers environmental aspects, conservation, and ecosystem dynamics. This broader perspective, combined with our passion, we are inspired to go with this program</p>
              <img src="Media/Fawzan2.jpg" class="imagephoto" alt="Decoration">
              <p class="intro">From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by the diversity of life around us—whether it’s creatures roaming the forests, thriving in rivers and oceans, or soaring through the skies. I wanted to dive deeper into understanding the unique habitats these animals call home. Initially, I was more acquainted with general biology programs, but as I learned more about marine biology, I realized it’s much more than just studying sea creatures. It encompasses the health of entire ecosystems, the impact of human activities, and the importance of preserving delicate marine environments. This comprehensive approach, combined with my genuine enthusiasm for nature, motivated me to pursue marine biology as my chosen field of study.</p>
              <img src="Media/Devibar.jpg" class="imagephoto" alt="Decoration">
              <p class="intro">The reason I chose this course is because I’m truly fascinated by the mysteries of the ocean and the incredible diversity of life it holds. I’m passionate about exploring marine ecosystems and doing my part to help protect them. I’m also deeply attracted to the beauty of ocean life and curious about how marine creatures live, adapt, and thrive in such a vast and dynamic environment. What intrigues me even more is the question of what truly lies in the unexplored depths of the ocean.</p>
