          <h2 style="margin-top: 150px">You might ask: What is <span class="highlight">Marine Ecology</span>?</h2>
          <p class="intro p-left">Marine Ecology is the scientific study of marine-life habitat, populations, and interactions among organisms and the surrounding environment including their abiotic (non-living physical and chemical factors that affect the ability of organisms to survive and reproduce) and biotic factors (living things or the materials that directly or indirectly affect an organism in its environment).</p>
          <p class="intro p-left">Marine ecology is a subset of the study of marine biology and includes observations at the biochemical, cellular, individual, and community levels as well as the study of marine ecosystems and the biosphere.</p>
          <p class="intro p-left">The study of marine ecology also includes the influence of geology, geography, meteorology, pedology, chemistry, and physics on marine environments. The impact of human activity such as medical research, development, agriculture, fisheries, and forestry is also studied under marine ecology. In some ways, marine ecology is more complex than the relatively straightforward study of a particular organism or environment because of the numerous interconnections, symbiotic relationships, and influence of many factors on a particular environment.</p>

          <p class="intro p-left">Marine ecology is not just about studying life beneath the waves—it's about understanding how the ocean functions as Earth’s life-support system. A healthy marine ecosystem is essential to the survival of countless species, including humans. From producing the air we breathe to buffering the impacts of climate change, marine ecosystems are a foundation for global stability. Here's a deeper dive into why marine ecology is vital:</p>
         
          <div class="section-multiplebox2" style="padding-top: 75px;">
              <p class="intro"><span class="highlight"><strong>Global Life Support System:</strong></span> Covering over 71% of the Earth's surface, the ocean plays a central role in maintaining planetary balance. It generates over <strong>half of the oxygen we breathe</strong>, largely thanks to marine phytoplankton, and absorbs <strong>more carbon dioxide than all the world’s rainforests combined</strong>. This immense body of water also regulates the Earth’s temperature, weather patterns, and supports the global water cycle. Without it, life as we know it would not exist.</p>

          <h2 style="margin-top: 150px">Welcome to the <span class="highlight">World of Ichthyology</span></h2>
          <p class="intro p-left">Ichthyology is a specialized branch of zoology devoted to the scientific study of fish. It explores the biology, behavior, classification, anatomy, and ecology of a vast array of fish species. From colorful coral reef dwellers to deep-sea predators, ichthyology provides essential insights into the lifeforms that inhabit aquatic environments around the globe.</p>
          <p class="intro p-left">Ichthyology is commonly defined as 'the study of fish' or 'that branch of zoology dealing with fish'. A fish is, literally, a vertebrate (i.e., animal with a backbone) that has gills, a body covered with scales, and lives in the water. However, some species are well known for their ability to leap clear of the sea surface and glide long distances using their fins as wings. In addition, other species can live out of the water for quite sometime, walk to migrate to other water bodies using auxiliary breathing organs, and some species do not have bodies covered with scales. Also, the word fish is sometime used more broadly to include any edible animal living in water. Here, we limit ourselves to fish in the narrow sense; note that the term 'fishes' refers to more than one type of fish; 'finfish' refers to sharks, some rays and bony fishes, and 'scalefish' refers to fish bearing scales.</p>
          
          <h2>Defining what is <span class="highlight">Ichthyology</span></h2>
          <p class="intro p-left">At its core, ichthyology focuses on understanding fish in all their diversity. It involves observing how fish grow, move, feed, reproduce, and interact with their surroundings. The discipline brings together multiple fields of science to build a comprehensive view of fish biology and their role in nature.</p>
        
          <h2>Key Fields Within <span class="highlight">Ichthyology</span></h2>
          <p class="=intro p-left">Ichthyology covers several essential fields that help explain how fish function and survive:</p>
          <p class="intro p-left" style="padding-left: 50px;">• <span class="highlight"><strong>Taxonomy</strong></span> - Identifying and classifying fish species.</p>
          <p class="intro p-left" style="padding-left: 50px;">• <span class="highlight"><strong>Anatomy</strong></span> - Investigating the internal and external structure of fish.</p>
          <p class="intro p-left" style="padding-left: 50px;">• <span class="highlight"><strong>Physiology</strong></span> - Exploring how fish systems operate, from respiration to circulation.</p>

          <h4>3. <span class="highlight">Impact of Climate Change</span></h3>
          <p class="intro p-left">Climate change poses significant threats to fish populations through altered water temperatures, acidification, and habitat loss. Ichthyologists study these impacts to predict shifts in species distributions and inform adaptive management strategies.</p>
          <h4>4. <span class="highlight">Economic and Societal Importance</span></h3>
          <p class="intro p-left">Fish are a primary source of protein for billions of people worldwide and are central to global economies through commercial and recreational fishing industries. Ichthyological research supports sustainable fisheries management, ensuring food security and economic stability.</p>
          <h4>5. <span class="highlight">Advancements in Science and Technology</span></h3>
          <p class="intro p-left">Research in ichthyology contributes to various scientific fields, including genetics, physiology, and environmental science.

          <h2 style="margin-top: 150px">Biodiversity Without Backbones: <span class="highlight">Invertebrate Zoology</span></h2>
          <p class="intro p-left">Invertebrate zoology is the branch of biology devoted to studying animals without backbones, a remarkably diverse group that makes up over 95% of all known animal species. These organisms range from microscopic zooplankton to giant squid and inhabit virtually every environment on Earth — from deep ocean trenches to tropical rainforests, freshwater lakes, and even urban soil.</p>
          <p class="intro p-left">This field delves into the diversity, anatomy, physiology, behavior, evolution, and ecology of invertebrate groups such as arthropods (e.g., insects and crustaceans), mollusks (e.g., snails and octopuses), echinoderms (e.g., sea stars and sea urchins), cnidarians (e.g., jellyfish and corals), annelids, sponges, and more. These animals are essential to life on Earth — they pollinate crops, recycle nutrients, form coral reefs, drive marine food webs, and influence global climate patterns.</p>
          <p class="intro p-left">But the study of invertebrates extends far beyond identifying and classifying species. Invertebrate zoologists also explore:</p>
