            <p class="intro">First and foremost, we've always been interested in animals—whether they live on land, in water, or in the sky. I’ve been eager to understand the environments they inhabit. When it came time to choose a program, I was initially more familiar with BS biology than with marine biology specifically. But as I explored further, I discovered that marine biology goes beyond just studying marine animals—it also covers environmental aspects, conservation, and ecosystem dynamics. This broader perspective, combined with our passion, we are inspired to go with this program</p>

            <h2>Engr. Fawzan Alsaber D. Alaman RCE, PE, CE</h2>
           <p class="intro">From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by the diversity of life around us—whether it’s creatures roaming the forests, thriving in rivers and oceans, or soaring through the skies. I wanted to dive deeper into understanding the unique habitats these animals call home. Initially, I was more acquainted with general biology programs, but as I learned more about marine biology, I realized it’s much more than just studying sea creatures. It encompasses the health of entire ecosystems, the impact of human activities, and the importance of preserving delicate marine environments. This comprehensive approach, combined with my genuine enthusiasm for nature, motivated me to pursue marine biology as my chosen field of study.</p>

            <p class="intro">I’ve always been drawn to the natural world, fascinated by the incredible variety of animals that inhabit every corner of the Earth—on land, in the oceans, and up in the air. My curiosity about how these creatures survive and interact with their environments grew stronger over time. While I initially leaned toward a general biology path, exploring marine biology opened my eyes to its wider scope. It’s not just about the animals themselves, but also about understanding marine ecosystems, addressing environmental challenges, and promoting conservation efforts. This holistic view, combined with my passion for wildlife, inspired me to commit to studying marine biology.</p>
